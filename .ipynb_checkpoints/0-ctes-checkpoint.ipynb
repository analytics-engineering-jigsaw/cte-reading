    "In this lesson we learned about CTEs.  The CTE allows us to create a temporary table and then query from that table.  We write our CTE with the following syntax:\n",

    "In general, we use CTEs to break our code up in to multiple steps.  For example, we saw how we can use CTEs to perform a multilevel aggregation, where we first calculated the average movie runtime per studio and year, and then from there found the studio with the highest average runtime per year.
